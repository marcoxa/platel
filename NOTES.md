# Notes

This is a first attempt to use Emacs dynamic module facility.
The top `platel.el` file is empty and all the action is in the `c`
folder.

The code in the `c` folder should be straightforward and it is very
very bare bone.  FTTB it is just a test to see how to make things
work; plus it is built with only Mac OS Sonoma (Intel) in
mind. YMMV, etc etc etc.

Tested on Sequoia and it works as well.
