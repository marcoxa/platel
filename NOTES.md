This is a first attempt to use Emacs dynamic module facility.
The top `platel.el` file is empty and all the action is in the `c`
folder.

The code in the `c` folder should be straightforward and it is very
very bare bone.  FTTB it is just a test to see how to make things
work; plus it is built with only Mac OS Sonoma (Intel) in
mind. YMMV, etc etc etc.

Tested on Sequoia and it works as well.

Started work to make code portable to UN*X (Linux) and Windows.

Compiling and loading working on Mac OS, and, most likey, other UN*X
(some more tweking necessary).  Manual compilation works also on
Windows 11 with MS Visual Studio `nmake`.  `cmake` setup works form
Mac OS and UN*X, but not yet for Windows 11.
